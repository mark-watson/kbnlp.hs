Mark Watson's Haskell NLP Experiments

This project also includes some experiments using Haskell for SPARQL clients.

I am currently working on using, when possible, DBPedia URIs as identifiers for entities detected in text. As is much of this project, this is a work in progress.


## Credits

I use the Haskell stemmer written by Dmitry Antonyuk and the sentence splitting code written by Eric Kow.

Thanks!!

## Generated code

There are a fair number of Haskell "source" files that were generated by Ruby scripts that are not included in this project.

These files (e.g., CityNamesDbpedia.hs, Category1Gram.hs, Category2Gram.hs, etc.) mostly use Data.Map.fromList to create in-memory maps for lingusitic and other data. These files are not particularly interesting. The more interesting code is found in the top level files Summarize.hs, Entities.hs, etc.



## Running the NLP examples - without cabal

cabal install yesod

cabal install hsparql   -- also installs MissingH, which is useful!

cabal install json

cabal install encoding

cabal install split

cabal install download-curl

runghc WebApp.hs

runghc Entities.hs

runghc Summarize.hs

etc.

## Running the NLP examples - with cabal

~~~~~~~~
cabal install --only-dependencies

cabal repl
~~~~~~~~

Inside cabal repl:

~~~~~~~~
:l Categorize.hs
main

:l Summarize.hs
main
~~~~~~~~

etc.
