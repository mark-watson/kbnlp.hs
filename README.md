I am currently working on using, when possible, DBPedia URIs as identifiers for entities detected in text. As is much of this project, this is a work in progress.


## Credits

I use the Haskell stemmer written by Dmitry Antonyuk and the sentence splitting code written by Eric Kow.

Thanks!!

## Generated code

There are a fair number of Haskell "source" files that were generated by Ruby scripts that are not included in this project.

These files (e.g., CityNamesDbpedia.hs, Category1Gram.hs, Category2Gram.hs, etc.) mostly use Data.Map.fromList to create in-memory maps for lingusitic and other data. These files are not particularly interesting. The more interesting code is found in the top level files Summarize.hs, Entities.hs, etc.

## Using stack

stack build
stack exec nlpdemo

then open http://localhost:3000
